# Solidity Practice Repository 🚀

Welcome to my **Solidity Practice Repository**! 🎉 Here, I explore and practice writing smart contracts using Solidity, the primary programming language for Ethereum and other EVM-based blockchains.

## 🏗️ **What’s Inside?**
This repository contains various Solidity examples and challenges to improve my understanding of:
- Solidity basics (data types, variables, functions).
- Advanced concepts (mappings, structs, inheritance).
- Building and deploying smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.

---

## 🛠️ **Technologies Used**
- **Solidity**: Programming language for smart contracts.
- **Remix IDE**: For writing and testing contracts.
- **Hardhat**: Ethereum development environment.
- **MetaMask**: For interacting with contracts.
- **Ganache**: Local blockchain for testing.
